## The Important stuff

My CV can be downloaded using this [link](../assets/CV). 

I am currently studying Computer Science (BSc) at the University of Glasgow. My current interests are in low level programming and visualisations. However, CS is a vast field and I am always looking to find new interests. 

My third year electives give some more insight to my interests: 

> Operating Systems, Network Systems, Database Systems, Cyber-security fundamentals

My current Honour GPA (3rd & 4th year) is: 19.5/22.

## Projects

The majority of my projects have been personal projects that have centered around visualising simulations with C++, using graphical libraries such as SFML. I plan to convert these projects to OpenGL in the future, making using of parrell computation with compute shaders.

* ## Strange Attractors 

   Visualised a series of strange attractors in 3D. The project was designed to be highly extendable, allowing for new attractors to easily be added. 

* ## Boids

   A simple boid simulation in C++ using SFML implemented using efficent data structures such as QuadTrees. 

* ## Traceroute Visualisation

   Built off the back of a university assignment from the Network Systems course where we were tasked to generate router topologies from traceroutes, this weekend project visualises routes packets take through the network using CesiumJS and ipstack (a IP geolocation API).

* ## CamMap
   
   Integrated mapping software for 2D and 3D land systems.  
   Developed over the course of 6 months by a 5 person team as part of my university degree. The project was in co-operation with an interal team at Thales, a multi-national defense company.

   Held the roles of Scrum Master and acting Product Owner from the majority of the project, leading Scrum meeting and handling all comunication with the customer. 

More about my personal projects can be found [here](../projects), on the projects page.
