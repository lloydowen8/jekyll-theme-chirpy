One of my favourite visualisations to date, this project uses the equations from strange attractors to deminstrate there chaotic nature.
The project was designed to be highly extendable, allowing new attractors to be easily added. It was implemented using C++ and SFML (an OpenGL graphics library),
with plans to convert it to pure OpenGL in the future. 

Inspiration for the project came from serveral other similar projects that were found on YouTube by [Orfeas Liossatos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idpOunnpKTo) and [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDSIRXmnVvk&t=34s) with the aim of making a less artistic, more mathematical project.

I hope you enjoy the demonstation (made with p5, a JavaScript library) and the video below.
