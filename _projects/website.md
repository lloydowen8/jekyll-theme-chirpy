The largest and most expansive project that I have undertaken to date. This project, in colaberation with Thales, was a really good learning experience in the challenges of working within a small scale software development team, from documentation to customer relations.

The project was centered around prototyping and developing integrated mapping software for the SophieLite target locator (something none of the team had any sort of experience in). The implementation used a vast array of technogies, from TypeScript to Rust. 

It was an exciting challenge being given a limited specification sheet, an hour of requirement gathering with the customer and then being told to get on with it. The team did extraordinary well overall, even though we couldn't get the system fully integrated due to Covid-19, we still achieving an A2 grade and a very happy customer!
