Yet another boids simulation! Almost a right of passage for anyone interested in visualisations and simulations, this is my implementation in C++ and SFML using QuadTrees.
Although in a fairly basic state at the moment I have a few ideas that I want to try in the future such as: converting it to 3D, increasing the number of boids using compute shaders,
adding "herding" rules.

It still amazes me that the combination of such simple rules can lead to such complex behaviour, enjoy the demonstration made with p5 and the video demonstation below!
