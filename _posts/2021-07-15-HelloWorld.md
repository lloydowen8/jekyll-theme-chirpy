This blog is hopefully going to act as a nice little time capsule for me to look back on in the future. I'm still unsure about the extent of which I'm going to use this and what exactly for but I have some ideas that I'll go into

## Notes

I have a good habit of getting completely engrossed in a new language, technology, subject, etc, of computer science and then completely forgetting what I've learned about what I was just doing. My plan is to write some simple, understandable notes on what I'm learning as I go along, so that if I do need to come back to whatever it was that I was doing I don't have to waste time completely re-learning it.

I plan to spend the next couple of weeks studying OpenGL so I can convert some of my existing projects to that. This is probably going to revolve around everthing upto and including compute shaders. 

After that who knows, I'm interested in learning Rust before the next semester starts and diving into one of the courses I'm planning to take next semester (Advanced Systems programming). 

## Projects

I plan to write a blog post on each of the projects I have undertaken. Hopefully this will serve to give more of a background as to the motivations behind the project, the lessons learned, and the research that went into it. 

If nothing else at least it will be somewhat good practice for me writting my dissertation next year. 

## Books

Last year I signed up to audible, and then promply forgot about it. While annoyed that I had seemingly wasted Â£50, it has allowed me to pick some computer science related audio books with the tokens they give you every month. 

I managed to pick up "Algorithms to Live By" by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths, "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide" by John Sonmez (God knows I need all the help I can get with coding interviews), and "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Anna Katarina. Hopefully they will have some valuable lessons to teach me, if not at least they will drown out the background while I slowly lose my mind coding.
